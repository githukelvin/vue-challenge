## Overview

The "Random Wise Quotes" app uses the [Quotable](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable) API to display a list of quotes with their ratings. Unfortunately, the sorting functionality is experiencing some issues.

## The Bug

When the "Get New Quotes" button is clicked, the sorting order is not preserved. The sort order should remain intact even after the user gets new quotes

## The Mission

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, involves two key tasks:

1. Investigate why the sorting functionality breaks after fetching new quotes and fix it.
2. Ensure that quotes are sorted in "desc" order right from the initial request.
